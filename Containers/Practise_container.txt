The moment that I first saw you, you were standing in the middle of the crowd, laughing and talking to a friend. There was something about you, maybe it was in the way you laughed or the way your eyes lit up, and I knew that there was this undeniable attraction that I felt for you. I was shy, nervous and I hesitated just a little bit when I asked you to dance with me. We were strangers and, when you said yes, I swear my heart skipped a beat. Ever since that night, I have known that we were destined to be together and not a day goes by when your love does not prove me right. I love you, much more that you can imagine, and I just want you to stay mine forever.
